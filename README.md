# Cap Lang

CapLang is a programming language that aims to be
memory safe and exception safe

## Usage

The examples directory has some examples you can try compiling.
Only examples/test.l should be tested on because that's the
one that I test on :-)

## Plans

The language and compiler are at a really early stage so there
is a lot of progress to be made

- Compile an ELF binary
- Detect basic memory safety issues
- Perform basic optimizations
- Add cool features
